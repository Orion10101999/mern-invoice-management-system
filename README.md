# Invoice Management System

## Features

1. **User Registration and Login**
   - Users should be able to register by providing their name, email, and password.
   - Registered users should be able to log in using their email and password.
   - Upon successful login, a JWT should be generated and stored on the client side (e.g., in localStorage).

2. **Invoice Management**
   - Administrators should be able to create, read, update, and delete invoices.
   - An invoice should include the following fields: invoice number, customer name, amount, due date, and status (paid, unpaid).

3. **Invoice PDF Generation**
   - Implement a feature to generate and display invoices as PDF documents.
   - Use a library like `pdfkit` or `jspdf` for PDF generation.

4. **Dashboard with Analytics**
   - The dashboard should display the total number of invoices, number of paid/unpaid invoices, and invoice amount trends (e.g., total amount per month).
   - Use a library like `Chart.js` to visualize the data.

5. **Secure API Endpoints**
   - Implement middleware to protect API endpoints.
   - Only authenticated users should be able to access the endpoints.
   - Use role-based access control to restrict certain operations to administrators.

6. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the backend on Heroku.
   - Deploy the frontend on Vercel.
